                <p class="par">Hi, first of all, thanks for visiting this page. This page is all about me - Sourav Dhali (Founder of Clever Coder). You will get exciting things about my life. <br> <br>

                About Clever Coder : Success is all about taking new initiatives. I started developing clever coder in the year 2022. At the moment, I was providing training on Java. Meanwhile, I thought, why not to spread my knowledge to the world. So I started developing Clever Coder by HTML, CSS, JS, MySQL and PHP. <br><br>

                Why I started the Clever Coder : If you try to help others, God will help you surely. A student from another teacher came to me and said, Sir I asked for the slide (PPT) from the Sir (Don't want to mention any name) to my sir and he scolded me. I told him not to worry, we are nothing; we haven't made anything, we are just delivering the things in a better way, since I don't use any PPT, I will put all my notes on the web, you people can learn from there. It was just to help the students. I was unaware of any kind of business. <br> </p>

                <p class="par">About Me : What to say about myself, I don't know. I am a simple guy from childhood, keen to learn new things and implement new ideas. Never worried about what I don't have. What I have is the best thing. I was born in Chitalmary, Bagerhat, Khulna, Bangladesh. Currently, I am living in Khulna, Bangladesh. <br> <br>

                Education : I got education from 1 to 5 in the primary school near my home, I don't have too many memories of that time, we were using pencil or there was no pen facility, electricity was the main problem there. There were only 4-5 hours electricity available at that time. I switched from there after that. I studied 6 to 10th in the half-government school because of the better education. At class 8 i had to choose Art, Commerce or Science. My elder brothers suggested me to go for the Science side, it will be easier for you. So I opted the Science side. I studied 10 to 12th from K.D.B Smriti Degree College, Chitalmary, Bagerhat. It was 1.5 km away from my home. <br> </p>

            <div class="text">
                <p class="par">Interest in Computer : After completing the 12th, I asked my parents to go to khulna for completing my study, I was suggested to do the MSc in Computer Science. So, I was join in Northern University of Business and Technology. Now i am a final year student. <br><br>

                Sports: If you play sports, you fail sometimes, and it teaches you keep going. In childhood, I was enjoying playing games like I Spy, Lattu (spinning top), Flying kite, Gilli Danda, Badminton etc. Later on I started playing PUBG, GTA etc. I played too many tournaments, and host one tournament also. After the 12th, I left everything, because I was out of home. It was not the metro city, so there was the limited scope and family was not supporting those games. so I became the career-oriented guy. <br><br>

                Failures: You can't get success without failures. After doing the 12th, I failed in the entrance exam of A unit in any Govt University. It happened because I was weak in some subjects at that time. But, I was the master of my subject. <br><br>

                Struggle: You can't get success without struggle, determination, hard work and decision-making ability. I don't want to specify my struggle here because, in the end, result matters. <br><br>

                
                I always think : "It's just a beginning". I have to achieve more. I have the option to sell my tutorials for money. But, I don't bound myself in those little amount of money. I want to see my growth endless. It's not my dream to touch the sky, I want to go beyond the sky. Finally, I would like to say, It's just the beginning. <br> <br>

                Belief in God : I have a strong belief in the existence of God. I think we are made of energy. One day, we will lose our energy, and it will go to the God again. <br><br>

                About Success : Everybody has different thoughts on Success. What are the key points to get successful? Luck! May be but not all the time. There are a lot of factors that makes a person successful: positive thinking nature, your goal: you must know what do you have to do in life, decision-making ability, your working nature in setback and failures, time management: what are you doing now and what will you do in future, ready to take risks, and innovative ideas. Being ideal defines your success. <br><br> 

                At the end : Death is the bitter truth of life and it is the universal truth. But, before this, I have to do something inspiring, and be an ideal.</p>
